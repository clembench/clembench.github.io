The *clemscore* combines a score representing the overall ability to just follow the game instructions (separately scored in field *Played*) and the quality of the play in attempt where instructions were followed (field *Quality Scores*). For details about the games / interaction settings, and for results on older versions of the benchmark, see the tab *Versions and Details*.
